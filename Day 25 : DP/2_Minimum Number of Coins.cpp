// Coin change(Leetcode)   or  Minimum number of coins to make a Amount(GFG)   or minimum elements(codeStudio)


// Greedy Approach Fails:
//For example, if coins = [1, 3, 4] and amount = 6, the greedy approach (always taking the largest coin) would give 4 + 1 + 1 (3 coins),
//but the optimal solution is 3 + 3 (2 coins).
